# vite-soccer-display
Little project to experiment with Vite and maybe some frontend design libraries

Idea: simple page using nice css library - pulls data from soccer API https://api-football-standings.azharimm.dev/ linked here and displays the leagues in a nicely paginated table.
          Afterwards, explore clicking into the leagues to pull data from the other endpoints documented here: https://github.com/azharimm/football-standings-api.
